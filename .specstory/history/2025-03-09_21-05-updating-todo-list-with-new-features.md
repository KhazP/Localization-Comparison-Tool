I'll help you analyze your Localization-Comparison-Tool repository and identify potential improvements. Let's break this down step by step.

First, I'll gather information about your repository:

```javascript
planskill(
  "Analyze the repository KhazP/Localization-Comparison-Tool, search for similar localization tools on GitHub, and identify potential missing features or code improvements"
)
```

<plan>
1. Get an overview of the repository's structure and contents using get-github-data
2. Analyze the README and documentation to understand the tool's purpose and current features
3. Search for similar localization comparison tools on GitHub using get-github-data
4. Compare features between this repository and similar tools
5. Look for common patterns, best practices, and features that might be missing
6. Check for code quality indicators, test coverage, and other technical aspects
</plan>

Let me first examine the repository structure and README to understand what your tool does:

```javascript
get-github-data("/repos/KhazP/Localization-Comparison-Tool/contents")
```
