The error occurs because your local Git configuration still points to the old repository name. You need to update the remote URL to match your renamed repository:
Then use the **Git: Remove Remote** command to remove the incorrect remote:
Finally, add the new remote URL using the **Git: Add Remote** command:
When adding the new remote, use the URL: https://github.com/KhazP/Localization-Comparison-Tool.git
After updating the remote, use the **Git: Sync** command to synchronize with the repository:

There is no tracking information for the current branch.
Please specify which branch you want to merge with.
See git-pull(1) for details.

    git pull <remote> <branch>

If you wish to set tracking information for this branch you can do so with:

    git branch --set-upstream-to=Localization-Comparison-Tool/<branch> main

# Git Push Error Resolution

You're getting this error because your local repository is behind the remote repository. This happens when there are commits in the remote repository that you don't have locally.

## Solution Options

### Option 1: Pull and then push (recommended if you want to keep remote changes)

```bash
# Pull the remote changes into your local branch
git pull Localization-Comparison-Tool main

# Resolve any merge conflicts if they occur
# Then push again
git push -u Localization-Comparison-Tool main
```

### Option 2: Force push (only if you want to overwrite remote changes)

⚠️ **Warning**: This will discard any commits on the remote that aren't in your local repository.

```bash
git push -u Localization-Comparison-Tool main --force
```

### Option 3: Pull with rebase

This replays your local changes on top of the remote changes:

```bash
git pull --rebase Localization-Comparison-Tool main
git push -u Localization-Comparison-Tool main
```
