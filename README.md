- Performance optimizations

Please see the issues page for current development priorities.

## üìö Tips & Best Practices

### For Best Performance
- Use auto-reload sparingly with very large files
- Consider using directory comparison for batch operations
- Export large comparison results to CSV for analysis in external tools

### Workflow Recommendations
- Enable auto-reload during active development
- Use custom ignore patterns for generated or timestamp-based keys
- Save frequently used comparison settings as defaults
- Export results before making major changes to source files

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations

- **Very Large Files**: Files with 50,000+ keys may require patience during initial parsing
- **Complex XML**: Highly nested XML structures might need preprocessing
- **Memory Usage**: Large comparison sessions consume RAM proportional to file size
- **File Encoding**: Works best with UTF-8 encoded files
