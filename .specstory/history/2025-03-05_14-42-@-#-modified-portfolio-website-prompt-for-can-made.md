@ # Modified Portfolio Website Prompt for Can Maden

I want to create a personal portfolio website to showcase my artistic work and accomplishments as a Turkish painter. Please help me design a modern, responsive website with the following sections:

1. Home page with a brief introduction about myself as an artist
2. About Me section detailing my artistic background, approach, and themes in my work
3. Gallery/Artwork section to showcase my paintings and mixed media pieces
4. Experience section highlighting my education, exhibitions, and teaching positions
5. Contact section with a form or my professional contact information

My professional background is in Fine Arts, specifically painting and mixed media, and I want the design to reflect artistic elegance and contemporary aesthetics.

Technical preferences:

* I prefer a clean, gallery-style presentation for my artwork that allows visitors to focus on the details and textures of my pieces
* I don't have extensive coding experience, but I understand basic HTML/CSS and can make minor updates to the site
* I prefer **HTML/CSS** for a clean, artist portfolio site that puts the focus on my work. The simplicity allows my artwork to be the primary visual element without distraction. For image galleries, I appreciate lightweight JavaScript libraries that enable smooth transitions and immersive viewing experiences.
* However, I also recognize the benefits of content management systems like **WordPress** with artist-focused themes that would allow me to easily update my portfolio and share news about upcoming exhibitions. For showcasing my diverse body of work, I value systems that offer flexible gallery layouts and high-resolution image display capabilities.

Ultimately, I'm looking for a solution that presents my artwork beautifully while being manageable for someone with limited technical expertise. The platform should prioritize visual presentation and allow for organizing works by series, medium, or chronology.

* I need the site to be mobile-friendly, SEO optimized, and visually appealing, ensuring that it provides an exceptional viewing experience for my artwork across all devices. The layout should be responsive, preserving the integrity of the visual presentation regardless of screen size.

Additionally, I want the website to be structured in a way that enhances my visibility to galleries, curators, and art collectors. This includes implementing proper heading hierarchies, using descriptive alt tags for artwork images, and optimizing meta descriptions to include relevant art terminology. Loading speed is essential for displaying high-resolution images of my artwork, so the site should be developed with performance optimization techniques.

Content should authentically represent my artistic voice and philosophy, incorporating art-related keywords that align with collectors' and curators' search patterns. A news or blog section should be included to announce upcoming exhibitions, artist talks, and new works, while thoughtful internal linking can guide visitors through related series or thematic collections.

Furthermore, I would like to include clear contact information for exhibition inquiries, social media integration to connect with the art community, and analytics tools for understanding visitor engagement with different artworks. Ensuring image copyright protection is crucial, as is compliance with privacy regulations.

Overall, the goal is to create a comprehensive digital portfolio that not only showcases my artistic vision but also connects me with galleries, collectors, and fellow artists in the contemporary art world.

For the gallery section, I want to highlight these artwork collections:

* **Miniature Landscapes Series**: A collection of mixed media collages exploring natural environments as metaphorical spaces, including "Miniature Landscape 6" (48x70 cm) and related works that invite viewers to contemplate the relationship between internal emotional states and external natural settings.
* **Forest Series**: Mixed media collage works including "Forest 3" (48x63 cm) that examine the forest as both physical space and psychological symbol, using layered materials to create depth and texture that mirror the complexity of natural environments.
* **Mist Collection**: Works including "Mist 1" (48x63 cm) that use collage techniques to create atmospheric natural scenes with evocative visual textures suggesting various emotional states and perceptions of reality.
* **Feminine Perspective Studies**: A series exploring psychological processes that connect individual and collective experiences from a distinctly feminine perspective, inviting viewers to contemplate the relationship between self and society.
* **Nature as Metaphor**: Works that use natural imagery to articulate complex interior emotional states, juxtaposing inner emotional landscapes with external natural environments to create multilayered viewing experiences.
* **Installations and Assemblages**: Three-dimensional works that extend my artistic vision beyond the canvas, incorporating found objects and mixed materials to create immersive experiences that engage viewers spatially and emotionally.
* **Digital Photography Explorations**: A series of digital photographs that capture ephemeral moments in nature and transform them through digital manipulation, creating hybrid images that exist between documentation and artistic interpretation.
* **Drawing Collection**: A selection of drawings that serve as both independent works and studies for larger projects, revealing my artistic process and the evolution of ideas across different mediums.
