# Localization Comparison Tool Improvement To-Do List

Based on the analysis of the "KhazP/Localization-Comparison-Tool" repository, here's a comprehensive to-do list for improving the AI-generated codebase:

## 1. Code Organization & Architecture

- [ ] **Refactor Monolithic App Class**: Break down `flet_gui.py` (500+ lines) into smaller, focused modules
- [ ] **Implement MVC/MVVM Pattern**: Separate UI from business logic with:
  - Model: Create `TranslationModel` for core logic
  - View: Create `MainView` for UI components
  - Controller: Create `SettingsController` for configuration
- [ ] **Relocate Business Logic**: Move comparison logic from `logic.py` to the `` package
- [ ] **Reorganize Directory Structure**: Move `` into `` directory for consistency
- [ ] **Create Service Classes**: Implement dedicated services for:
  - `ThemeService` for theme management
  - `FileService` for file operations
  - `TranslationService` for translation features

## 2. Performance Optimization

- [ ] **Implement Worker Threads**: Use `ThreadPoolExecutor` for heavy operations to prevent UI blocking
- [ ] **Optimize Caching**: Replace current cache with LRU cache in FileCacheService
- [ ] **Improve Async Operations**: Fix inconsistent asyncio usage:
  - Use `asyncio.to_thread` for blocking operations
  - Properly await all tasks with error handling
- [ ] **Minimize UI Updates**: Reduce `page.update()` calls by updating only specific controls
- [ ] **Optimize File Processing**: Implement chunked reading and generators for large files

## 3. Error Handling & Validation

- [ ] **Implement Specific Exceptions**: Replace generic `Exception` catches with specific exceptions
- [ ] **Use Custom Exception Classes**: Consistently use classes in `errors.py`
- [ ] **Add Input Validation**: Implement validation decorators for file paths, sizes, etc.
- [ ] **Unify Error Display**: Standardize how errors are shown (snackbar vs. console)
- [ ] **Create Error Middleware**: Implement central error handling system

## 4. Code Quality & Best Practices

- [ ] **Add Type Hints**: Complete type annotations throughout the codebase
- [ ] **Improve Docstrings**: Add comprehensive function/class documentation
- [ ] **Standardize Naming**: Use `snake_case` consistently for variables and functions
- [ ] **Reduce Duplication**: Consolidate duplicate code (especially parsing logic)
- [ ] **Address TODOs/FIXMEs**: Resolve existing TODO comments in the code

## 5. Testing & Documentation

- [ ] **Expand Test Coverage**: Add unit tests for core functions and parsers
- [ ] **Fix Snapshot Tests**: Update `format_component` to handle all Flet control types
- [ ] **Create Documentation**: Add Sphinx documentation with API references
- [ ] **Create Architecture Doc**: Add `ARCHITECTURE.md` explaining component relationships
- [ ] **Improve README**: Enhance user and developer documentation

## 6. Security

- [ ] **Secure Credential Storage**: Use keyring for API keys instead of plaintext
- [ ] **Implement Input Sanitization**: Add path validation to prevent security issues
- [ ] **Use Environment Variables**: Store sensitive data in environment variables

## 7. Parser Management

- [ ] **Create Parser Registry**: Implement a registry system in `__init__.py`
- [ ] **Implement Plugin Architecture**: Create a `ParserPlugin` abstract class for easier extension
- [ ] **Refactor Parse Function**: Replace the complex switch statement in `parse_content_by_ext`

## 8. Configuration Management

- [ ] **Externalize Default Config**: Move hardcoded defaults to `config/defaults.json`
- [ ] **Add Config Validation**: Validate configuration on load
- [ ] **Implement Settings Manager**: Create a dedicated settings management service

## 9. Additional Improvements

- [ ] **Set Up CI/CD**: Create GitHub Actions workflow for testing and linting
- [ ] **Implement Internationalization**: Extract hardcoded strings for localization
- [ ] **Add Performance Metrics**: Implement benchmarking for key operations
- [ ] **Improve Logging**: Implement structured logging with proper severity levels
- [ ] **Fix Packaging**: Use `flet pack` instead of `setup.py` for distribution
