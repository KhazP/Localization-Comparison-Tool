# Updating placeholder text in project documentation (2025-03-09 17:41:30)

Do I need to edit anything? Like a placeholder text?

# Review of Placeholder Text in Your Project

Looking through your project files, I've identified two placeholder texts that should be updated:

1. In `SECURITY.md` (line ~11):
   ```md
   2. **Email** your findings to [your-email@example.com] (replace with your preferred contact email)
   ```
   This should be replaced with your actual contact email (probably `alpyalay@gmail.com` which is used elsewhere).

2. In `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` (line ~52):
   ```md
   Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
   reported to the project maintainer at [INSERT YOUR CONTACT INFO HERE].
   ```
   This needs your contact information.

The `start_localizer.bat` file that you're currently viewing doesn't appear to have any placeholder text that needs updating - all values look correctly set with your actual information.

Would you like me to suggest specific changes to fix these placeholder texts?

# Batch File Review

I've reviewed your `start_localizer.bat` file, and there are no placeholder texts that need editing. All values appear to be properly set:

- Application metadata is defined with actual values:
  - `APP_NAME=Localization Comparison Tool`
  - `APP_VERSION=0.5` 
  - `APP_AUTHOR=KhazP`

- The contact email is properly specified as `alpyalay@gmail.com`

- All paths use environment variables or relative references correctly

The only section that might eventually need implementation rather than text editing is:

```bat
:: Check for updates (can be replaced with your update mechanism)
echo   [%TIME:~0,8%] Checking for updates...
echo   [%TIME:~0,8%] Running latest version
```

This has a comment suggesting it could be replaced with an actual update mechanism in the future, but it's not a placeholder text that needs immediate editing.

The batch file looks ready to use as-is.
