# Localization Comparison Tool

A Flutter-based desktop application for comparing localization files, tracking changes, and assisting with the translation process.

## Features

*   **Modern UI System:** Light/dark themes, tabbed navigation for Basic, Advanced, History, Git, and Settings views. Mockups provided by user are guiding UI development.
*   **Real-Time Comparison Engine:** Supports various file formats (XLIFF, TMX, CSV, JSON, YAML, Properties, RESX, XML, TXT, DOCX) with diff highlighting in the Basic View. Utilizes Isolates for parsing. `.lang` files are parsed as plain text, where each line is treated as both a key and a value (similar to `.txt` files). `.txt` and `.docx` files are treated as list-of-phrases, where each line is a key.
*   **Translation History & Diff Tracking:** Stores past comparison sessions in Hive. A History View displays these sessions in a sortable and filterable table, with options to clear history (with confirmation) and reload a past comparison into the Basic view.
*   **Application Settings:** User-configurable settings (Default File Formats, Ignore Patterns, Ignore Case) are implemented with persistence in Hive. UI is available in the Settings tab.
*   **AI-Assisted Translation (Stubbed):** Core BLoC, Service (Google Translate API stub), and Cache (stub) structures are in place.
*   **Git Integration (Stubbed):** Core BLoC and Service (libgit2dart stub) structures are in place.

## Database Schema

The application uses Hive for local data storage.

## Completed Milestones

- **Robust Theming System**:
  - Light/Dark/Amoled themes that react instantly to user changes.
  - Dynamic accent color applied throughout the application.
  - Diff colors ("Added," "Removed," "Modified") are user-configurable and reflected in all comparison views.
- **Advanced Settings UI**:
  - Modern two-panel layout for settings.
  - Fully functional controls for General, Comparison Engine, and Appearance settings.
  - All settings are persisted locally using Hive.
- **Enhanced Comparison Engine**:
  - Core diffing logic refactored into a separate, testable `DiffCalculator` class.
  - Test suite now directly validates the production diffing logic.
  - Fixed a critical bug where "removed" strings were not correctly identified.
  - Full support for `ignoreCase`, `ignoreWhitespace`, and `ignorePatterns` options.
- **Stable Core Infrastructure**:
  - Navigation, state management (BLoC), and persistence (Hive) are stable.
  - All major views (`Basic`, `Advanced`, `History`, `Settings`) correctly apply themes, including Amoled.
- **File Handling Settings**:
  - Implemented a new "File Handling" section in the settings view.
  - Users can configure default source/target encodings, auto-detection, and CSV parsing options.
  - File system settings like auto-reloading and default export directory are now available.
  - All file handling settings are persisted locally.
- **Full Integration of File Settings & Bug Fixes**:
  - Connected all "File Handling" settings (e.g., encoding, CSV delimiter) to the core comparison engine, making them fully functional.
  - Refactored the file parsing logic to correctly use the new settings.
  - Resolved a critical crash caused by passing a non-transferable `HiveObject` to a background isolate, making the comparison process more robust.
- **Flexible Directory Comparison**:
  - Implemented a "Files" tab to compare entire directories.
  - The system automatically detects identically named files in the source and target directories.
  - A robust manual pairing system allows users to match source and target files with different names via a simple dialog.
  - The UI clearly separates paired files from unmatched source and target files.
  - A "Compare" function runs a diff on all paired files and displays added, removed, and modified stats for each pair directly in the UI.
  - A "View" button opens a popup dialog showing a detailed list of added, removed, and modified keys for each specific file pair.

## Development Roadmap

### ðŸš§ Up Next
- **Settings View - Remaining Sections**:
  - Implement "AI Services" (API key management).
  - Implement "Version Control" settings.
  - Implement "About" page content.
  - Add "Reset to Default" functionality for all categories.

### ðŸŒ± Future Goals
- **Advanced Directory Comparison View**: Integrate a powerful, side-by-side diff viewer for directory comparison results, similar to the existing "Advanced" view for single files.
- **Translation Cache**: Implement Hive persistence for `TranslationCache`.
- **AI Translation Service**: Fully implement `GoogleTranslationService`, including secure API key storage and integrate into UI.
- **Git Integration**: Implement `LibGit2DartService` using `libgit2dart` for actual Git operations. Build UI for repository selection, branch listing, and displaying branch comparison results.
- **UI & UX Polish**:
  - Refine file previews and progress reporting.
  - Enhance error handling and result exporting.
