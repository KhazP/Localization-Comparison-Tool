@workspace Please review for production readiness: check for common vulnerabilities, secure headers, forms, input validation, authentication, error handling, debug statements, dependency security, and ensure adherence to industry best practices.

# Production Readiness Review

Based on the available code and documentation in your Localization Comparison Tool workspace, here's a production readiness assessment focusing on security:

## Documentation Strengths

- Well-structured security policy detailing vulnerability reporting process
- Clear code documentation standards
- Established code of conduct

## Areas to Verify/Improve

### Security Testing
- Your test_integration.py includes validation tests, but consider adding specific security tests that verify:
  - Input sanitization
  - File path traversal prevention
  - Memory handling for large files

### Input Validation
- Ensure all file parsers validate input thoroughly before processing
- Based on `test_placeholder_validation()`, you're validating placeholders, which is good
- Consider implementing a comprehensive input sanitization framework

### Error Handling
- Review all error handlers to ensure they don't expose sensitive information
- Implement centralized error logging

### Dependency Security
- Add automated dependency scanning during CI/CD
- Document the process for auditing and updating dependencies
- Consider adding a `DEPENDENCIES.md` file listing critical dependencies and their security status

### Secure Development
- Implement pre-commit hooks for security linting
- Consider adding automated SAST (Static Application Security Testing) to your workflow

### Documentation Updates
- Add developer onboarding section to security documentation
- Include a security checklist for contributors

## Recommendations

1. Implement a formal security testing framework
2. Create an explicit threat model document
3. Establish regular security review cadence
4. Add a security section to your pull request template
5. Consider a third-party security audit before major releases

Your current security practices (as documented in SECURITY.md) show good awareness, but implementing these additional measures would further strengthen your application's security posture.
