# The error message indicates that `pip` cannot find (2025-04-13 17:55:48)

The error message indicates that `pip` cannot find a version of `pylint` that matches the constraint `pylint>=4.2.5,<7,!=5.13.0`. The available versions listed stop at `3.3.6`, so version `4.2.5` or higher does not exist yet.

You need to adjust the version constraint for `pylint` in your `requirements.txt` file.

Please change line 12 from:
`pylint>=4.2.5,<7,!=5.13.0`

to a constraint that reflects available versions, for example:
`pylint>=3.0.0,<7,!=5.13.0`

Here is the updated line in a code block:

````pip-requirements
# ...existing code...
darkdetect==0.8.0
flake8>=6.0.0
pylint>=3.0.0,<7,!=5.13.0 # Adjusted lower bound from >=4.2.5
pytest>=7.4.0
isort<6
# ...existing code...
````

After saving the changes to `requirements.txt`, run the installation command again in your terminal:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

Okay, I can help with that. Here's the plan:

1.  Modify the `pylint` version constraint in `requirements.txt` to `pylint>=3.0.0,<7,!=5.13.0`.

### [requirements.txt](file:///c%3A/Users/alpya/Documents/GitHub/LocalizerAppMain/requirements.txt)

Update the version constraint for pylint.

```pip-requirements
# Requirements for LocalizerAppMain
flet>=0.21.0
colorama==0.4.6  # Pinned to specific secure version due to recent compromise
ruamel.yaml>=0.17.0
tomlkit>=0.11.8
GitPython>=3.1.41  # Updated to address multiple security vulnerabilities (CVE-2024-22190, CVE-2023-41040)
requests>=2.31.0
PyYAML>=6.0.1  # Updated to address arbitrary code execution vulnerabilities
lxml>=4.9.3
darkdetect==0.8.0
flake8>=6.0.0
pylint>=3.0.0,<7,!=5.13.0 # Adjusted lower bound from >=4.2.5
pytest>=7.4.0
isort<6
tomli>=1.1.0
exceptiongroup>=1.0.0rc8
iniconfig>=2.0.0
